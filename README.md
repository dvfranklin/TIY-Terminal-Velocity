## TIY Day 1 Assignment: Terminal Velocity

This repository contains several dummy files that helped to teach command line and Github.

These files include:

1. date.txt - the number of seconds that have passed since 1 January 1970.
2. hosts - a copy of OS X's hosts file.
3. joke.txt - a bad musician joke, the only family friendly joke I could remember.
4. list of text files.txt - an example of using ls, * and redirection.
5. list-project-directory.txt - an example of using ls with redirection.
6. terminal-history-for-this-assignment.txt - a warning that I need to learn how to clear my terminal history.
7. where-is-my-java.txt - displays locations of java and javac bin files, courtesy of the "which" command.
8. workingDirectory.txt - uses pwd with redirection.
